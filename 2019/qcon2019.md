## How fast can you read a file?

- Are you limited by your disk or
- Are you limited by your CPU?

---
## An iMac disk: 2.2 GB/s

![](diskspeed.png)

---
## Reading text lines (CPU only)

#~0.6 GB/s

```java
void parseLine(String s) {
  volume += s.length();
}

void readString(StringReader data) {				
  BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(data);
  bf.lines().forEach(s -> parseLine(s));
}
```

## JSON 

- Specified by Douglas Crockford 
- [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) by Tim Bray in 2013
- Ubiquitous format to exchange data

```javascript
{"Image": {"Width":  800,"Height": 600,
"Title":  "View from 15th Floor",
"Thumbnail": {
    "Url":    "http://www.example.com/81989943",
    "Height": 125,"Width":  100}
} 
```

- "Our backend spends half its time serializing and deserializing json"

review perf of javascript json parser

show rapidjson

then show simdjson

c++ but wrapper in python, c#, rust, javascript ruby

ports to rust and c#

be obsessive 
plot performance per commit

hard-to-predict branches are evil, find worst case scenario

do not microbenchmark branchy code

counting instruction retired is not a bad metric, and it more objective given deterministic code

use machine learning to build hardware specific models and gain better understanding 

runtime dispatching works but is surprisingly tricky and uncommon in c++, jit has an advantage

parsing numbers is tricky and expensive 

review simd: not just for crunching numbers
review arm neon, sse, avx

discuss vector classification 

show how we can detect escape sequences and the inside of quotes

utf8 validation

the challenge with high level languages

do not allocate thousands of tiny objects: use a memory block

architecture: stage 1 and stage 2, not a matter of skipping white spaces... stage 1 works over 64 bytes






not independent costs
