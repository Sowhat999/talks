---
# About the course

- Not a technical class
- Not about a programming language in partical
- Make you curious. Encourage you to dig deeper.
- Motivate you !

---
# Caveats

- If you have never programmed, and you merely follow six weeks of classes, you won't know much about programming.
- If you are an expert programmer, it is possible that much of what I cover will be known to you.


---
# Cognitive stretch

- To get better, you have to be unconfortable.
- It pushes you to get better...
- ... as long as you do not let yourself become demoralized.

---
# Fun

Let us try to have fun !

*Keep your mind open*



---
# Week 1

Learning or re-learning programming in 60 minutes.

---
# What is programming?

- Not the use of a programming language.

---
# What is programming?

- Processing information.


---
# What is programming?

- The world is too complex.
- Programmers must 'manage complexity'.

---
# Main tool of the programmer

- Abstraction

---

# Caveat

All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
(The Law of Leaky Abstractions, Spolsky)


---
# Making matters worse

- Programming is social.


---
# Python

- Simple and powerful
- Readable
- Not *very* fast

---
# Python online

- https://www.online-python.com
- https://replit.com

---
# Python values

- numbers, strings, sets, lists...

---

# Arithmetic

```
>>> 0.1+0.2+0.3+0.4
1.0
```

---

# Comparing values

```
>>> 0.1 == 0.1
True
```

---

```
>>> 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
False
```

---

```
>>> 0.1+0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

---
# At the beginning

- bits
- bytes
- machine words 


---
# Where is the data

- network
- disk
- memory
- cache
- register
- all of the above
