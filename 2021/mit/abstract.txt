Parsing numbers at a gigabyte per second


Back when disks could barely provide megabytes of bandwidth per second, slow data processing software was acceptable. It is now time to revisit our performance expectations. With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second, parsing decimal numbers from strings  becomes a  bottleneck. We consider the problem of parsing decimal numbers to the nearest binary floating-point value. We present a C++ implementation that is often 4 times faster than standard C library on modern 64-bit systems (Intel, AMD, ARM and POWER9). Our work is available as open source software used by major systems such as Apache Arrow and Yandex ClickHouse. The Go standard library has adopted a version of our approach. The Rust port of our library is much faster than the state-of-the-art lexical library.
